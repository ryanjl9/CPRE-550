## How to build

To build the project, run the following command: `make all`. Assuming you have all of the project libraries installed, this will generate two binary files in the `./bin` directory within this folder. **NOTE: There will be build warning that pop up due to the autogenerated code from `rpcgen`.** The binary files generated `make all` are compiled with the `-O2` compiler flag. You can also generated debug binaries which include the `-ggdb` flag by executing the following commands: `make client_dbg` and `make server_dbg`.

## How to run the server

To run the project, execute the following command: `./bin/server`. Or if you would like to run the server in the background: `./bin/server &`. From here, the server doesnt' need to be touched.

## How to run the client

To run the client, execute the following command: `./bin/client`. Once executed, the client will launch into an interactive command-line application which excepts different commands. To view these commands, type the following `help`. If running a server on the same machine in the background, you can run the following command `server add localhost`. Otherwise, you will need to add a remote server using the same `server add <server>` command. Once a server has been registered, more can be added if needed. You can select which server you're sending commands to by using the `server select <index>` where index is the index in the list that is presented when running the `server list` command.
