# CPRE-550

This will be a repository for all my projects in CPRE 550.

## Project 1: Remote System Monitoring Using RPC

The purpose of this project is to design a system which can monitor statistics of a remote machine transparently using RPC. These statistics will include the following:
- Date and Time (either separately or together)
- CPU utilization
- Memory usage
- Loaded processes per minute
